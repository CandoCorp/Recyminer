# Recyminer

Pollution by trash is a considerable global problem that affects oceans, the environment and quality life. One problem of the current recycling system is its inefficiency. The customer needs to separate each product and then look for where to send the products that the public trash system won’t collect.

Not all places require trash to be separated; and this app could contribute to adding more people to help create a functional recycling system just by uploading a picture of their market receipt or a description of their non-functional, old goods.

Most people when not knowing what to do with their daily waste or their non-use products (a broken refrigerator, old clothes, old batteries, etc), they just throw them in the garbage (increasing pollution) or leave them in a corner of their houses. All of these non-use products could have a second life as final products or raw material and the application will help make the collection efficient globally.

## Problem Solved

Global electronic waste generation reached a record high of 53.6 million metric tons in 2019. This was an increase of 21 percent in just five years and worked out at approximately 7.3 kilograms of e-waste per capita. Asia accounted for almost half of global e-waste in 2019, having produced 24.9 million metric tons worth. The majority of this was produced in China, which is the world’s largest e-waste producer. 

However, while Asia generates far more e-waste than other regions, on average it produces just 5.6 kilograms per person. In comparison, the volume of e-waste generated per capita in Europe and the Americas is considerably higher, at 16.2 kilograms and 13.3 kilograms, respectively. Many countries that produce the most e-waste per capita are in Europe, such as Norway, the United Kingdom, and France.

In 2019, the global share of e-waste documented to be collected and properly recycled was just 17.4 percent. This is despite electronic products consisting of valuable materials that can be reused or recycled, such as gold, silver, and cobalt; which is vital for rechargeable batteries. Europe has the highest collection and recycling rate of e-waste, at 42.5 percent. There have been proposals in the European Union for countries to legally be required to recycle critical metals found in e-waste as a way to reduce reliance on imports.

As waste generation has increased over the years, so too has the volume of materials recycled and composted. However, the recycling rate in the United States stands at just over 30 percent. Of the roughly 300 million metric tons of Municipal solid waste generated in the U.S., much is discarded at landfills.
There are more than 1,200 municipal waste landfills in the U.S., with a large number of operating landfills located in California. The waste management company Waste Management Inc. accounts for more than a quarter of the total waste managed in U.S. landfills. As of 2020, there were more than 12,000 businesses in the U.S. waste collection services industry, employing more than 200,000 people.

## Objective
- Reduce urban waste by allowing _**miners**_ to search for recyclable materials, cloths and e-waste to be further sold to _**sellers**_ or recycling companies.

## Short Term Goals
- Help reduce the incorrect trash management that will end in rivers and oceans, by encouraging users to upload their market receipts with store credit and having a place where they can publish the things they do not know where to throw and letting recyclers pick it up with any or no cost.
- Show the recyclers specific points where they can find raw materials like plastic, batteries, old clothes, etc.
- People can buy guaranteed, refurbished products, cheaper than new ones and completely functional, completing the recycling cycle.

## App Profiles

- ### User
The user can request a miner to take off an unused product for any or no cost. The user can also upload his consumption recipes for app credit to buy products in the app.

- ### Miner
The miner can choose between picking up products or going to specific recollection waste points to collect recyclable goods. The miner can select if selling or not the product as raw material. If the miner wants to sell it as a final product, he must register as a seller.

- ### Seller
The seller buys raw material and sells, through the app, a refurbished final product. All the final products must be with a function guarantee.

## Where the app could be used

**_Recyminer_** can be used globally. The misuse of the public waste recollection system has contributed to the environment pollution; this can contribute to making the most of the general waste and connecting people who can transform this “trash” to refurbish and useful products.

## Assumptions
- Users will upload their garbage recollection hours.
- Users will indicate when or where they have e-waste, cloths disposal or any other direct consumer product.
- Miners will have a mobile device they can follow to do their track.
- Companies could participate as recyclers and contribute to the circular economy.
- Users can win points by and sharing their garbage status.
- Users can put their garbage as a recyclable group to increase their rewards.

## Out of Scope

- Garbage classification from user perspective.
- Payments within platform.
- Management and optimization of routes.

## Conclusion

This project attempts to create a functional recycling ecosystem where waste (plastic, paper, clothes, technology or waste by itself) can have a second use life as raw materials or to refurbished products. The environmental impact could be considerable. 

People who do not know what to do with their waste or damaged goods will have the opportunity to get rid of their waste without leaving home, and the waste will be collected by people who can give it a better use and make the most of it.

Another perk of using **_Recyminer_**, it will be economically sustainable. Just by uploading receipts, users will receive app credits to buy products from sellers; or they could make cash by putting a price on their non-use products (users), raw materials (miners) or selling refurbished or second - hand products (sellers).
